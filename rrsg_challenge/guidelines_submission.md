## Guidelines for submissions

The goal of every submission is to produce the following items:

* An implementation of the algorithm in Figure 1 of [1]. Any programming language, as well as third-party software (e.g. implementations of the Non-Uniform Fourier transform or the Conjugate Gradient Algorithm) is fine, as long as the source code can be shared and the computational results can be reproduced.

* Subsample the provided brain data by factors 2,3 and 4 (48, 32 and 24 projections), do a reconstruction, calculate the error to the 96 projections reconstruction and plot the error and the number of iterations according to the results in Figure 4 in [1].
* For the same data, show reconstruction results for different iteration numbers and a version from a single receive coil according to the results in Figure 5.

* Reconstructions of the provided cardiac data using the first 55, 33, 22 and 11 projections corresponding to the cardiac results in Figure 6.



We prefer that participants create an online code repository (e.g. GitHub) where the submission is uploaded. However, submissions via email attachment, via a shared link to a cloud drive etc. are also acceptable.

Participants should submit their reconstruction code, scripts to perform the experiments as well as the plots described above to:

rrsg.challenge@gmail.com


## What happens after the submission?

This is not a competition. We will not be “scoring” or “ranking” any of the submissions at the annual meeting. The goal will be to discuss the experiences the community had reproducing the results from the paper. For example, were there any particular roadblocks and challenges, how consistent are the submissions, etc.

Submission repositories will be highlighted on a special section for the reproducibility challenge on the ISMRM code webpage, MR-Hub (https://www.ismrm.org/MR-Hub/).
Participants will get a “Supporting Reproducibility” ribbon at the 2019 annual ISMRM 2019.
Participants will be given the opportunity for a 3-min time slot at the study group meeting at the 2019 ISMRM annual meeting to present their results and share their experiences (optional).
